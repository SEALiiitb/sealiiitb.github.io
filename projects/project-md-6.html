		<h2>Architecture and design decisions in complex systems and system-of-systems  </h2>
		<p>
		We consider design and architecture of complex systems and
		system-of-systems as a set of decisions. Our work focusses on
		knowledge involved in architecting such systems and how the underlying
		knowledge evolves with uncertainties, learning cycles and their
		consequences as the architected system is developed and deployed. We
		have developed a framework that involves decision and knowledge models
		and have integrated them into a learning model that predicts the
		probabilities of the different learning cycle consequences for various
		system decisions. A suggestion to practically implement the framework
		is also proposed.
