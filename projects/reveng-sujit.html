		<h2>Extraction of Architectural Knowledge from Legacy Code</h2>
			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

		<p>
		Maintenance phase is often the longest running phase of software 
		development lift cycle. In maintenance phase, a software project is
		typically handled by engineers who weren't there from the beginning.
		The code and other artifacts are 'legacy' for these engineers. The
		original contributors to the project have moved on, and with them is
		gone a lot of unwritten knowledge. Legacy code, which has been working 
		well is both hard to maintain and to throw away. Design and architectural
		documentation is scanty. So, the maintenance engineer has to figure out
		what the original contributor had in mind. The usual techniques used to
		do this is code review, testing and a lot of guesswork.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this project, we are developing a set of algorithms, mostly
		based on program analysis, to extract the high level architectural
		facts about legacy code. Our algorithms analyse the code and 
		identify features and patterns which correspond to certain known
		design and architectural tricks, e.g. design pattern, architectural
		patterns and tactics.
