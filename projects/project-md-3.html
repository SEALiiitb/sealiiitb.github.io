		<h2>Verifiable avionics self-adaptive software</h2>
		<p>
		Intelligent and adaptive avionics systems for ground and air-side
		operations are being designed to improve overall performance and
		operational efficiency by the aerospace industry. While systems have
		to be adaptive, they also have to be safe, deterministic and failure
		free. There is a need for developing methodologies and frameworks that
		enable design of intelligent avionics systems that can be certified
		and/or formally proven to be safe. We propose a BDI (Belief Desire
		Intention) based multi-agent system model for intelligent avionics
		systems that possess adaptive features for intelligent decision making
		and also is amenable for being formally verified. Our BDI models have
		been formally specified in the formal language Z, they use learning
		algorithms to be adaptive and have components that can take over to
		ensure safety in case there is a risk of failure. Our Z models can be
		abstracted and model checked against CTL specifications by NuSMV model
		checker. We also propose a few measures to measure adaptibility of
		these systems. Our framework has been tested using two large case
		studies--- one involving flight planning and another one with a small
		unmanned aerial system.
